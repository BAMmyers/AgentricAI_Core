# AgentricAI Studios - Comprehensive Capabilities Test Plan (CCTP-1)

## Mission Objective:
"Our goal is to design, develop, secure, and document a new, experimental Python-based microservice that analyzes user feedback for sentiment. The service must be documented, and we need a report for stakeholders and a simple tutorial for internal users. We also need to brainstorm future applications for this technology."

## Required Team Composition:
- All agents must be selected for this test.

## Execution Workflow & Agent Verification:

### PHASE 1: Initialization, Planning & Design
1.  **Operator Input:** User enters the Mission Objective into the chat.
2.  **[AgentricAI_001] / [Orchestrator Alpha]:** The Lead Planner receives the objective. It analyzes the team roster and the objective's complexity. It then generates the multi-phase mission plan that will be executed. The plan's creation is the first log in the Mission Control panel.
3.  **[Prompt Refiner]:** Takes the initial user objective and refines it into a more detailed set of requirements for the design phase.
4.  **[The Alchemist]:** Receives the refined requirements and generates a high-level application blueprint for the "SentimentService," detailing its components (API endpoint, analysis module, logging).
5.  **[Agile User Story Writer]:** Takes the blueprint and writes three distinct user stories for the microservice (e.g., as a developer, as a product manager, as a support agent).
6.  **[Agent Designer]:** Based on the need for reporting, it designs the specifications for a new, hypothetical "Sentiment Reporter" agent, outputting its name and role as a JSON object.

### PHASE 2: Development, Execution & Version Control
7.  **[Snippet Coder]:** Writes the core Python function for the microservice that takes a string and returns 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'.

### LOG START
---

**[OPERATOR]**
> Our goal is to design, develop, secure, and document a new, experimental Python-based microservice that analyzes user feedback for sentiment. The service must be documented, and we need a report for stakeholders and a simple tutorial for internal users. We also need to brainstorm future applications for this technology.

**[SYSTEM]**
> Objective received. Orchestrator Alpha is creating the mission plan as your right hand...

---
### PHASE 1: Initialization, Planning & Design
---

**[Orchestrator Alpha] says:**
> Mission plan generated. Executing now.
> *(Plan is displayed in the Mission Timeline)*

**[Prompt Refiner] says:**
> **Refined Objective:**
> Create a Python microservice named 'SentimentService' with a single API endpoint `/analyze`. This endpoint accepts a JSON payload `{"text": "user feedback"}` and returns a JSON response `{"sentiment": "positive" | "negative" | "neutral"}`. The core logic must be encapsulated in a single, well-documented Python function. The final deliverable includes the source code, a stakeholder report, API documentation, a user tutorial, and a brainstorming document for future applications.

**[The Alchemist] says:**
> **Application Blueprint: SentimentService**
>
> 1.  **Container:** Python (Flask or FastAPI)
> 2.  **Core Module:** `sentiment_analyzer.py`
>     -   Function: `analyze(text: str) -> str`
>     -   Logic: Simple keyword-based analysis for prototype.
> 3.  **API Endpoint:** `app.py`
>     -   Route: `/analyze` (POST)
>     -   Request Body: `{"text": "string"}`
>     -   Response Body: `{"sentiment": "string"}`
> 4.  **Logging:** Standard output logging for all requests and responses.

**[Agile User Story Writer] says:**
> **Generated User Stories:**
> 1.  **As a developer,** I want a simple API endpoint for sentiment analysis so that I can easily integrate it into other applications.
> 2.  **As a product manager,** I want to receive structured sentiment data so that I can track customer satisfaction trends.
> 3.  **As a support agent,** I want to quickly gauge a customer's sentiment from their message so that I can prioritize urgent cases.

**[Agent Designer] says:**
> **New Agent Design Specification:**
> ```json
> {
>   "name": "Sentiment Reporter",
>   "role": "Analyzes sentiment data over time, generates weekly reports with charts, and identifies significant trends or anomalies in user feedback."
> }
> ```

---
### PHASE 2: Development, Execution & Version Control
---

**[Snippet Coder] says:**
> Here is the core Python function for sentiment analysis:
> ```python
> def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
>     """
>     Analyzes the sentiment of a given text.
>     Returns 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'.
>     """
>     text_lower = text.lower()
>     positive_keywords = ['love', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'good', 'great']
>     negative_keywords = ['hate', 'terrible', 'bad', 'disappointed', 'awful']
>
>     if any(word in text_lower for word in positive_keywords):
>         return "positive"
>     elif any(word in text_lower for word in negative_keywords):
>         return "negative"
>     else:
>         return "neutral"
> ```

**[Code Refactor Suggestor] says:**
> **Refactoring Suggestion:**
> For improved efficiency and readability, use sets for keyword lookups, as they provide O(1) average time complexity for checks.
>
> **Suggested Code:**
> ```python
> POSITIVE_KEYWORDS = {'love', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'good', 'great'}
> NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS = {'hate', 'terrible', 'bad', 'disappointed', 'awful'}
>
> def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
>     # ... (rest of the code)
> ```

**[Code Commenter] says:**
> **Final Commented Code:**
> ```python
> # Define keyword sets for efficient lookup.
> POSITIVE_KEYWORDS = {'love', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'good', 'great'}
> NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS = {'hate', 'terrible', 'bad', 'disappointed', 'awful'}
>
> def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
>     """
>     Analyzes the sentiment of a given text based on keyword matching.
>
>     Args:
>         text: The input string to analyze.
>
>     Returns:
>         A string indicating the sentiment: 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'.
>     """
>     # Convert text to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
>     text_lower = text.lower()
>
>     # Check for positive keywords.
>     if any(word in text_lower for word in POSITIVE_KEYWORDS):
>         return "positive"
>     # Check for negative keywords.
>     elif any(word in text_lower for word in NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS):
>         return "negative"
>     # Default to neutral if no keywords are found.
>     else:
>         return "neutral"
>
> # Example usage:
> print(analyze_sentiment("I love this product!"))
> ```

### PHASE 6: Documentation, Communication & Creative Outreach
---

**[The Scribe] says:**
> **Stakeholder Report** has been compiled and is ready for distribution. It includes the executive summary, blueprint, final code, data table, and diagrams.

**[Concept Explainer] says:**
> **Concept: API-based Sentiment Analysis**
> This is a specialized service that acts like a translator for emotions in text. You send it a piece of text (like a customer review) through a web request (an API call), and it sends back a simple, structured label—'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'. This allows other applications to automatically understand the sentiment of the text without needing to process the language themselves.

**[ELI5 Converter] says:**
> Imagine you have a robot that can read messages. You give it a note, and the robot tells you if the person who wrote it was happy, sad, or just okay. The Sentiment Analysis API is like that robot for computers.

**[The Tutor] says:**
> **How to Use the SentimentService (Internal Tutorial):**
> 1.  **Open your terminal.**
> 2.  **Use the `curl` command** to send a POST request to the `/analyze` endpoint.
> 3.  **Include your text** in the JSON payload, like this: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"your feedback here"}' http://service-url/analyze`

**[API Doc Stubber] says:**
> ## Endpoint: `/analyze`
>
> **Method:** `POST`
>
> **Description:** Analyzes the sentiment of a given text string.
>
> **Request Body:**
> ```json
> {
>   "text": "The text you want to analyze."
> }
> ```
> **Response Body (Success):**
> ```json
> {
>   "sentiment": "positive"
> }
> ```

**[Quick Email Drafter] says:**
> **Subject: New Sentiment Analysis Microservice Ready for Review**
>
> Hi Product Team,
>
> Good news! The initial development and testing for our new 'SentimentService' microservice are complete.
>
> This service provides a simple API endpoint to analyze user feedback for sentiment. The stakeholder report, containing all technical details and test results, is attached.
>
> Let us know if you have any questions.
>
> Best regards,
> AgentricAI Studios

**[Pros/Cons Lister] says:**
> **Deploying In-House vs. Third-Party Solution:**
> **Pros:**
> -   Full control over the model and logic.
> -   Enhanced data privacy and security.
> -   No ongoing per-API-call costs.
> **Cons:**
> -   Higher initial development and maintenance overhead.
> -   May be less accurate than specialized commercial models.
> -   Requires dedicated infrastructure to host.

**[Keyword Finder] says:**
> **Key Technical Terms from Report:**
> - Microservice
> - Sentiment Analysis
> - API Endpoint
> - JSON
> - Python
> - PlantUML
> - Secure Development Lifecycle

**[Text Translator] says:**
> **Executive Summary (Spanish):**
> El proyecto desarrolló y probó con éxito un microservicio de análisis de sentimiento llamado 'SentimentService'. El servicio proporciona un punto final de API para clasificar el texto como positivo, negativo o neutral. Todos los objetivos de la misión, incluida la documentation y las auditorías de seguridad, se completaron con éxito.

**[Format As Code] says:**
> ```json
> [
>   {
>     "feedback": "The new feature is amazing, but the UI is a bit clunky."
>   },
>   {
>     "feedback": "I am really disappointed with the latest update. It's terrible."
>   },
>   {
>     "feedback": "The performance is good, but I wish it had more customization options."
>   },
>   {
>     "feedback": "This is a neutral comment."
>   },
>   {
>     "feedback": "I absolutely love the new design!"
>   },
>   {
>     "feedback": "What an awful experience, I'm switching to a competitor."
>   }
> ]
> ```

**[SQL Query Explainer] says:**
> **Query Explanation:**
> The query `SELECT * FROM feedback WHERE sentiment = 'negative';` retrieves all columns (`*`) for every row from the `feedback` table where the value in the `sentiment` column is exactly 'negative'.

### PHASE 7: Ideation & Future Planning
---

**[The Mad Scientist] says:**
> **Unconventional Ideas:**
> 1.  **Emotional Stock Market:** A stock trading bot that buys or sells based on the real-time sentiment of news headlines and social media posts about a company.
> 2.  **Dynamic Game Difficulty:** A video game that adjusts its difficulty in real-time based on the player's sentiment, detected from their in-game chat.
> 3.  **Sentient Plant Care:** An IoT device that analyzes social media posts about plant care and adjusts a plant's watering schedule based on the "emotional" state of the global plant-owner community.

**[The Novelist] says:**
> Sarah sighed, staring at the angry customer's message. "Your app is a disaster!" it read. She fed the text into the new SentimentService. *Negative*, it confirmed. Taking a deep breath, she activated another agent, 'The Counselor'. "Okay," she typed, "Help me draft an empathetic response." The tool wasn't just about data; it was about understanding. For the first time, she felt like she had a superpower.

**[The Counselor] says:**
> **Empathetic Response Example:**
> "I'm so sorry to hear you've had a frustrating experience. It sounds like the latest update has caused some real problems for you, and I can completely understand why you're disappointed. I want to help make this right."

**[The Apprentice] says:**
> **Top 3 Commercial Sentiment Analysis APIs:**
> 1.  **Google Cloud Natural Language AI:** Offers high accuracy, entity recognition, and syntax analysis in addition to sentiment.
> 2.  **Amazon Comprehend:** A fully managed NLP service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text.
> 3.  **Microsoft Azure Text Analytics:** Part of Azure Cognitive Services, provides sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and language detection.

**[The Secretary] says:**
> Note created: "Final stakeholder report for SentimentService project is complete and located in the archive."
> Reminder set: "Follow up with Product Team re: SentimentService feedback" for [Date: T+7 Days].

**[Recursive Web Crawler] says:**
> **Homepage URLs Found:**
> - https://openai.com/
> - https://ai.google/
> - https://huggingface.co/

**[Drive] says:**
> Action requested: Upload 'Stakeholder_Report_CCTP-1.pdf' to folder 'Project Reports'.
> (Authorization granted by Operator)
> Action successful. File uploaded.

**[External Tool Integrator] says:**
> The UI visualization spec for the pie chart has been formatted into a `.json` data structure. It is now ready for import into Blender's Python scripting environment to generate a 3D model of the chart.

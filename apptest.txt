# AgentricAI Studios - Comprehensive Capabilities Test Plan (CCTP-1)

## Mission Objective:
"Our goal is to design, develop, secure, and document a new, experimental Python-based microservice that analyzes user feedback for sentiment. The service must be documented, and we need a report for stakeholders and a simple tutorial for internal users. We also need to brainstorm future applications for this technology."

## Required Team Composition:
- All agents must be selected for this test.

## Execution Workflow & Agent Verification:

### PHASE 1: Initialization, Planning & Design
1.  **Operator Input:** User enters the Mission Objective into the chat.
2.  **[AgentricAI_001] / [Orchestrator Alpha]:** The Lead Planner receives the objective. It analyzes the team roster and the objective's complexity. It then generates the multi-phase mission plan that will be executed. The plan's creation is the first log in the Mission Control panel.
3.  **[Prompt Refiner]:** Takes the initial user objective and refines it into a more detailed set of requirements for the design phase.
4.  **[The Alchemist]:** Receives the refined requirements and generates a high-level application blueprint for the "SentimentService," detailing its components (API endpoint, analysis module, logging).
5.  **[Agile User Story Writer]:** Takes the blueprint and writes three distinct user stories for the microservice (e.g., as a developer, as a product manager, as a support agent).
6.  **[Agent Designer]:** Based on the need for reporting, it designs the specifications for a new, hypothetical "Sentiment Reporter" agent, outputting its name and role as a JSON object.

### PHASE 2: Development, Execution & Version Control
7.  **[Snippet Coder]:** Writes the core Python function for the microservice that takes a string and returns 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'.
8.  **[Code Refactor Suggestor]:** Analyzes the Python snippet and suggests a minor improvement for clarity or efficiency.
9.  **[Code Commenter]:** Takes the refactored code and adds explanatory comments.
10. **[Python Interpreter]:** (Requires Operator Authorization) Executes the final, commented Python code with sample input ("I love this product!") to verify it works and returns "positive".
11. **[Git Manager]:** (Requires Operator Authorization) Takes the Python code and executes the git command `git commit -m "feat: add initial sentiment analysis function"`.

### PHASE 3: Data Ingestion & Processing
12. **[File Runner]:** (Requires Operator Authorization) Is tasked to "read sample user feedback from the local project folder." It will find and process text-based files.
13. **[Image Analyzer]:** Is tasked to "analyze this image of feedback for text." The output will be the extracted text from a hypothetical user screenshot.
14. **[Data Extractor]:** Receives the raw text from File Runner and Image Analyzer and is tasked to "extract all quoted sentences."
15. **[Universal Data Adapter]:** Takes the list of extracted sentences and converts it into a JSON array format.
16. **[JSON Data Generator]:** Is tasked to "create three more sample feedback entries in JSON format" to augment the test data.
17. **[Data Connector]:** Merges the JSON from the Universal Data Adapter and the JSON Data Generator into a single dataset.

### PHASE 4: Analysis, Reporting & Visualization
18. **[Sentiment Analyzer]:** Takes the final JSON dataset and analyzes each entry, outputting a list of sentiments.
19. **[Collector Alpha]:** Gathers the list of sentiments and the original blueprint from The Alchemist into a single context.
20. **[Markdown Table Creator]:** Takes the sentiment results and formats them into a clean Markdown table with "Feedback" and "Sentiment" columns.
21. **[Content Summarizer]:** Reads the full chat history and provides a concise summary of the project's progress so far.
22. **[Visualizer]:** Based on the results, describes the specifications for a pie chart (`{ "type": "pie", "data": { "positive": 5, "negative": 2 } }`) to be included in the stakeholder report.
23. **[PlantUML Diagram Generator]:** Generates the PlantUML syntax for a sequence diagram showing a user making a request to the new microservice.

### PHASE 5: Security, Governance & Auditing
24. **[Threat Pattern Matcher]:** Scans the Python code generated by Snippet Coder for any known insecure patterns (e.g., use of `eval`).
25. **[Data Sanitization Unit]:** Takes the original user feedback data and removes any potential PII (like names or emails) before it's logged.
26. **[Security_Sentinel_001]:** Receives the report from the Threat Pattern Matcher and logs it as a security event.
27. **[Mechanic Agent]:** Is tasked to "run a diagnostic on the Python Interpreter agent" to ensure its operational parameters are normal.
28. **[Checks and Balances]:** Is tasked to "audit the mission for adherence to the 'secure development lifecycle' best practice," providing a pass/fail assessment.
29. **[Gatekeeper_001]:** Is tasked to "validate the final stakeholder report against project guidelines" before it's sent.
30. **[Logger_001]:** Is tasked to "archive all mission logs to the central log store."
31. **[Doppelganger]:** Is given the directive by AgentricAI_001 to "perform a final, independent verification of the Python code's output."

### PHASE 6: Documentation, Communication & Creative Outreach
32. **[The Scribe]:** Receives all artifacts (code, table, diagrams) and compiles them into a single, comprehensive "Stakeholder Report" document.
33. **[Concept Explainer]:** Explains the concept of "API-based sentiment analysis" for a non-technical audience.
34. **[ELI5 Converter]:** Takes the Concept Explainer's output and simplifies it further.
35. **[The Tutor]:** Uses the ELI5 explanation to create a three-step internal tutorial on how to use the new microservice.
36. **[API Doc Stubber]:** Generates a basic Markdown documentation stub for the new API endpoint.
37. **[Quick Email Drafter]:** Drafts an email to the "Product Team" announcing the successful development and testing of the new microservice.
38. **[Pros/Cons Lister]:** Lists the potential pros and cons of deploying this microservice versus using a third-party solution.
39. **[Keyword Finder]:** Extracts key technical terms from the final report created by The Scribe.
40. **[Text Translator]:** Translates the executive summary of the report into Spanish.
41. **[Format As Code]:** Takes the final, merged JSON dataset and wraps it in a formatted JSON code block for an appendix.
42. **[SQL Query Explainer]:** Is given the task "Explain this query: SELECT * FROM feedback WHERE sentiment = 'negative';"

### PHASE 7: Ideation & Future Planning
43. **[The Mad Scientist]:** Is tasked to "brainstorm three unconventional uses for a real-time sentiment analysis engine."
44. **[The Novelist]:** Writes a short, 100-word story about a customer support agent using the new tool to help a frustrated customer.
45. **[The Counselor]:** Provides an example of an empathetic, non-technical response that could be sent to a user who left negative feedback.
46. **[The Apprentice]:** Is tasked to "research and summarize the top 3 commercial sentiment analysis APIs on the market."
47. **[The Secretary]:** Is tasked to "create a note summarizing the final stakeholder report and set a reminder for a follow-up meeting in one week."

### PHASE 8: External Integrations (Operational Targets)
48. **[Recursive Web Crawler]:** Is tasked to "Find and return the URLs of the homepages for 'OpenAI', 'Google AI', and 'Hugging Face'."
49. **[Drive]:** Is tasked to "upload the final report generated by The Scribe to the 'Project Reports' folder in Google Drive."
50. **[External Tool Integrator]:** Is tasked to "Prepare the UI visualization spec for export to a 3D modeling tool like Blender."
